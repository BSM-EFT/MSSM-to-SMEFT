# MSSM-to-SMEFT matching
This directory contains three files which allow the one-loop matching of the MSSM onto the Warsaw basis:

- the Matchte model file containing all model defintions (`MSSM.m`);
- two Mathematics notebooks for performing the matching and mapping onto the Warsaw basis: the notebook `MSSM-matching.nb` provides a compact code for the matching, whereas `MSSM-matching-detailed.nb` offers a more detailed step-by-step discussion of the indiviual matching parts.

The matching results obtained with these files can be found in the directory [matching-results/Mathematica](../matching-results/Mathematica).

*Notice that these files have been created for Matchete v0.3.0 and are not compatible with earlier versions of the program.*
