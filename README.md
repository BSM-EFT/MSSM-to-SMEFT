# MSSM-to-SMEFT
This repository contains the supplementary material for the paper "SUSY meets SMEFT: Complete one-loop matching of the general MSSM" by Sabine Kraml, Andre Lessa, Suraj Prakash and Felix Wilsch. 
Concretely we provide:

- the implementation of the MSSM in Matchete (see folder [matching](matching)); 
- the full matching results in the form of Mathematica and PDF files  (folder [matching-results](matching-results));
- example Mathematica notebooks showing how to use these results (folder [examples](examples)).

The matching is performed up to dimension six at a single scale $\bar\mu$, with the masses of all BSM states kept generic and non-degenerate.  
*Note that the code provided here requires [Matchete v0.3.0](https://gitlab.com/matchete/matchete/tree/v0.3.0) or higher!*
