# MSSM-to-SMEFT
This repository contains the supplementory material for the paper "SUSY meets SMEFT:
Complete one-loop matching of the general MSSM" arXiv:250x.xxxxx. Concretely we provide:

- the implementation of the MSSM in Matchete; 
- the full matching results in the form of Mathematica and PDF files;
- example Mathematica notebooks showing how to use these results.
