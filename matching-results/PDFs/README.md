# MSSM-to-SMEFT matching results in PDF format
This directory contains all matching results in the format of PDF files. The following files and directories are included:

- `tree-level_matching-conditions.pdf`: list of all tree-level matching conditions;
- [one-loop_matching-conditions](one-loop_matching-conditions): directory containing all one-loop matching conditions, split into one PDF file for every coefficient;
- `loop-function_definition.pdf`: definition of all loop functions present in the matching conditions.

*Notice that no shift of the renormalizable SMEFT couplings has been performed to obtain the PDF results, that is the results shown here in PDF format match the results in the file [MSSM-matching-conditions_detailed_not-shifted.m](../Mathematica/MSSM-matching-conditions_detailed_not-shifted.m)*
