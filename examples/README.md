# Examples

Here we provide the Mathematica notebooks for reproducing the results of *Section 5*.

In particular:

 * [threshold.nb](./threshold.nb) containts the threshold corrections to the SM parameters (at one loop for the gauge couplings and at tree-level for the other parameters)
 * [lambdaH_oneloop.nb](./lambdaH_oneloop.nb) contains the calculation for obtaining the one loop corrections from stops to the Higgs quartic coupling
 * [tree_level.nb](./tree_level.nb) contains the expressions for the Wilson coefficients generated at tree level
